# AI-Algorithms-for-Sudoku-Solver
We compare many algorithms namely Backtracking, Backtracking with heuristic ,Backtracking with 
heuristic (Forward checking and Arc consistency), Hill Climbing .Our aim is to compare the relative 
performance of these algorithms. We will assess the efficiency of each algorithm with respect to the 
input data, that is, to the number of givens, and with respect to the size of instance, in order to 
evaluate which kind of algorithm works best.
